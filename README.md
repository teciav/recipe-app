to start the application: npm run dev

This app uses:
- Vue router: to handle the routing of different views and the navigation in the SPA;
- Axios: to handle the API call slimmer and the code more readable;
- Sass, BEM: to handle the styling. Could have used tailwind, but good old sass does the job;
